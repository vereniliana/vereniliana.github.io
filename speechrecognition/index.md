# IN-CAR SPEECH RECOGNITION

Siri, Google Assistant, Cortana must be familiar for you. They are voice-controlled virtual assistant yang. All of them use one of popular technology, speech recognition. Often you can just speak certain words (again, as instructed by a recording) to get what you need. Speech recognition technology has endless applications. Commonly, such software is used for automatic translations, dictation, hands-free computing, medical transcription, automated customer service, in-car system and much more. 

Everyone from tech industry experts to casual shoppers at a local Best Buy has been introduced in some way to voice-activated technology. One area where voice-activation is making huge strides, though, is in the automotive industry. In-car speech recognition systems have become an almost standard feature in all many new vehicles on the market today. It might not be groundbreaking, but it might just save your life (and money on your insurance premiums).

## WHAT IS SPEECH RECOGNITION?

Speech recognition is the ability of a machine or program to identify words and phrases in spoken language and convert them to a machine-readable format. This technology allow devices capturing spoken words using a microphone or telephone and converting them into a digitally stored set of words. The quality of a speech recognition systems are assessed according to two factors: its accuracy (error rate in converting spoken words to digital data) and speed (how well the software can keep up with a human speaker). 

## HOW IT WORKS?

Speech recognition works using algorithms through acoustic and language modeling. Acoustic modeling represents the relationship between linguistic units of speech and audio signals; language modeling matches sounds with word sequences to help distinguish between words that sound similar. Often, hidden Markov models are used as well to recognize temporal patterns in speech to improve accuracy within the system.

Speech engines use this process to figure out what a speaker said:
1.	The engine loads a list of words to be recognized. This list of words is called a grammar.
2.	Audio from a speaker is captured by a microphone or telephone. This audio is turned into a waveform, a mathematical representation of sound.
3.	The engine looks at features — distinct characteristics of sound — derived from the waveform and compares them with its own acoustic model. The engine searches its acoustic space, using the grammar to guide this search.
4.	It then determines which words in the grammar the audio most closely matches and returns a result.

## WHY IN-CAR SPEECH RECOGNITION?

Safe driving behaviors requires us to ignore the constant phone calls, emails, and text messages while behind the wheel, that kind of disconnectedness isn’t the reality. A lot of voice technology was driven by the need to keep the public safe while still acknowledging the device-dependent epidemic. Whether it’s a text message or using your Maps App, the impulse to take our eyes off of the road has become second nature. In-car speech recognition systems aim to remove the distraction of looking down at your mobile phone while you drive. Instead, a heads-up display allows drivers to keep their eyes on the road and their mind on safety. 

Companies like Apple, Google, and Nuance are reshaping the way voice-activation is used in vehicles. Here are some of the most popular systems that enable drivers to find directions, send emails, make phone calls, and play music, all by using the sound of their voice.

#### Apple CarPlay

CarPlay brings a stripped down and safety-focused version of iOS to your car’s touch-screen display. Simply connect your iPhone and your car’s factory-installed entertainment system is replaced by Apple’s familiar icons. Siri is fully integrated into CarPlay. Press the voice button on your steering wheel and Siri will be there to help you switch between playlists, navigate to the nearest gas station, send text messages, and many more.

#### Google Android Auto

Unlike CarPlay, Android Auto connects via a USB cable, then relies on Bluetooth for voice phone calls through the car. Once your phone is plugged into the car, Android Auto activates a unique and important safety feature. It renders your phone basically useless to ensure you will not use it while driving.

There’s no need to pick it up, look at it, adjust the volume, nothing. All five screens are closer to the driver’s field of vision, and in a larger format than a smartphone screen. Which, hopefully, results in less time with your eyes off the road. The vehicle option will not allow users to download those darn viruses and malware from third-party app stores. Instead, Android Auto will rely on the Google Play store for content and upgrades.

#### Nuance

As part of its Dragon Drive platform, the Dragon Drive Automotive Assistant combines Nuance’s voice, cloud, and connectivity components and offers a comprehensive suite of features and services. One thing users may take to immediately is the “conversational” interface associated with Dragon Drive. Its ability to process natural voice patterns is far more sophisticated compared to its competitors. There are even voice bio metric capabilities that will recognize which user is speaking.

Dragon Drive “learns” your road behaviors and updates in order to meet your needs before even having to ask. This is a feature similar to Google’s Nest which “learns” and automatically adjusts for optimal temperature settings in your house.

No matter where in-car speech recognition goes next, consumers can rest assured that the focus is on equal parts safety and convenience. Plus, luring customers to a product with the latest bells and whistles isn’t all bad for the tech companies either. It’s important for drivers to remember that voice-activated does not equate to “distraction free”. It’s up to you to keep your eyes on the road.
